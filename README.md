Node Go AES encryption example
=============================
This is an example of how to encrypt a string using AES which is the passed between node.js and Go.

## Overview
I banged my head for quite a while in order to get AES encryption to work when sending a string between node.js and Go. Hopefully sharing this will stop others from having the same headaches.

Obviously, these would be used in seperate solutions.

**Disclaimer**

Although this code does work it isn't meant to be a fully functioning app but more an example of how it can be done. Please take the code "as is". You might need to tweak some of the flow to get it to work for you.
